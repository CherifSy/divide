Divide.io (Beta)
===========

Divide.io is an open source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). It provides tools to easily, securely, and efficiently communicate between your app and a server. It handles data storage, user registration & management, and push notifications.

Deploy anywhere. Use any database you want. Never get locked into a platform.

Visit [our website](http://www.divide.io/) for more information.

####How does it work?
Divide.io provides easy to use APIs to connect your mobile app to a backend. Getting up and running is simple.

1. Choose your backend provider. Our backend library can be deployed to any server that runs Java. This includes App Engine, AWS, etc.
2. Download our client libraries in your app.
3. That's it!
